(1)
I have made some suggested comments in the `fortran_code_replica.py` file.
I think that all of the suggestions I made in there relate to clarifying the comments describing the code

(2)
I have made a few suggested comments in the `test_fortran_code_replica.py` file.
These mainly relate to the need to describe in more detail where the expected test-results are coming from.
 - I.e. That you got them from running the orbfit fortran code, and that you printed out all of the variables,
   and that you then copied those values into the test file and are using them as a means to test that your
   python version is working correctly

(3)
I made a suggestion to restructure the `test_get_tau_values` function in the `test_fortran_code_replica.py` file.
Again, this is primarily to clarify where the test values come from.

(4)
You should probably clarify other functions in the `test_fortran_code_replica.py` file to ensure that they also
clearly describe where the results are coming from

(5)
You should rename the `math_fucntions.py` to `math_functions.py`
You will then need to refactor the import statements in the other files to reflect this change

(6)
In the `test_math_functions.py` file, I think it would be better and easier to read if you move the
test variables inside the function where you are doing the testing.
And also, I think you should put the expected numerical results inside appropriate variables
I.e. instead of writing
```
    assert float(results[0,0]) == -181.39997132286484
    assert float(results[1,0]) == 346.82086618012170
    assert float(results[2,0]) == -167.22601164748204
```
write something like
```
    expected_results = [-181.39997132286484, 346.82086618012170, -167.22601164748204]
    assert np.allclose(results[:,0], expected_results)
```

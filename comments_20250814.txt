Mila, I'm making a branch to explicitly document the comments/suggestions I have.
All of the important comments are in this file, but I have also added some comments in the `fortran_code_replica.py`
file itself.

As you are currently working on the `test_fortran_code_replica.py` and `gauss_method.py` files, I will
not comment on those today.

(1) Change the `Test` directory name to `tests` [not essential, but it is the standard name people use in python]
(2) Add a long description to the top of the `fortran_code_replica.py` file, explaining what the file does and that
    it doesn't really get used in the rest of the code, but rather was just a starting point to ensure you
    could accurately reproduce the results form the orbfit fortran code.
    You might also emphasize (if it is true) that the variable-names employed in the code are deliberately chosen to
    match those in the original Fortran code for easier comparison and understanding.
(3) In `fortran_code_replica.py`, consider adding type hints to function signatures for better clarity and type checking.
(4) In `fortran_code_replica.py`, add docstrings to all functions to explain their purpose and usage.
(5) Move the position_vector* and unit_vector* and observation_times variables out of the `fortran_code_replica.py`
    file and into the `test_fortran_code_replica.py` file
(6) In the README.md file, start to add in some extract sections that explain how to ...
    - download the code
    - install the code
    - run the tests
    - etc

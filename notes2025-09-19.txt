Some suggestions related to desirable content to include in both 
(a) Your thesis introduction;
(b) The first half / two-thirds of your talk in Portugal. 

N.B. I don't want to write your thesis for you, so I'll restrict myself to just listing some important 
topics that I think you should cover, as well as some suggested things to do & not-do (to avoid confusing 
your readers/audience) 

High Level Overview [not necessarily in this order] 
 - Why did Gauss want to calculate the orbits of asteroids ? 
 - Why do we want to calculate the orbits of asteroids / satellites ?
 - Perhaps provide some historical background to note that in order to solve this problem, 
   Gauss invented a *lot* of mathematics, including the Gaussian distribution and least-squares fitting
 - Be able to provide a very short overview of Gauss' method (you then give more details later on) 
 - Are there better methods? - Yes, tools like orbfit: but when you only have ~3 observations, Gauss' method is just as good and is *fast*

High Level Summary of Gauss' Method [this is probably similar to what you already have in your high-level summary in Paper.pdf] 
 - What are the key mathematical and physical assumptions / facts that are used in Gauss's method ? 
 - Highlight which of these are exact versus which are approximate 
 - What steps are involved to use those assumptions / facts / approximations to get to the 8th order equation? 
 - How do we solve the 8th order equation? 
 - How many roots can the 8th order equation have ?
 - Once we have solved the 8th order equation, what are the subsequent steps that we have to take in order to get to an *orbit*? 

More Detailed Topics [You probably need to get to these slightly later on in the intro/talk] 
 - What are Keplerian elements?
 - What are Cartesian elements ?
 - Why is there any need to convert back and forth between them (what are the advantages of either, why don't you just stick with one of them) ?

Do / Don't ...
 - Don't assume too much knowledge on the part of your audience/reader: 
   E.g. if you are going to talk about orbital elements, then you need to make sure you have introduced those already. 
   Or conversely, if you haven't introduced them already, perhaps you just get by with using less technical terminology in an earlier part of the introduction/talk,
   and delay any discussion of orbital elements (or similar technical terminology) until later on in the thesis/talk.

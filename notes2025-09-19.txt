Some suggestions related to desirable content to include in both 
(a) Your thesis introduction;
(b) The first half / two-thirds of your talk in Portugal. 

N.B. I don't want to write your thesis for you, so I'll restrict myself to just listing some important 
topics that I think you should cover, as well as some suggested things to do & not-do (to avoid confusing 
your readers/audience) 


High Level Overview [not necessarily in this order] 
 - Why did Gauss want to calculate the orbits of asteroids ? 
   --- Early 1800s, astronomers spotted a new object (Ceres). Then they lost it in the Sun’s glare.
   --- A young Carl Friedrich Gauss used a clever method to predict where to look so it could be found again.
   --- His approach turned a few imperfect observations into a reliable orbit prediction, kick-starting modern celestial mechanics and “orbit determination.”
 - Why do we want to calculate the orbits of asteroids / satellites ?
   --- Planetary defense: Estimating orbits of newly discovered asteroids to assess impact risk.
   --- Space traffic management: Tracking satellites and debris so they don’t collide.
   --- Mission navigation: Getting probes onto the right path to the Moon or Mars.

 - Perhaps provide some historical background to note that in order to solve this problem, 
   Gauss invented a *lot* of mathematics, including the Gaussian distribution and least-squares fitting

- Be able to provide a very short overview of Gauss' method (you then give more details later on) 

- Are there better methods? - Yes, tools like orbfit: but when you only have ~3 observations, Gauss' method is just as good and is *fast*




High Level Summary of Gauss' Method [this is probably similar to what you already have in your high-level summary in Paper.pdf] 
 - What are the key mathematical and physical assumptions / facts that are used in Gauss's method ? 
   --- Gauss’ method works because we temporarily simplify the universe:
       ----- Two-body world: Pretend the object and the Sun (or Earth, for satellites) are the only players. Gravity comes from one big body; everything else is a tiny nudge we ignore at first.
       ----- Short time span: The three sightings happen close enough in time that this “simple world” is a good approximation.
       ----- We know where we are: The observer’s position (Earth’s location in space, or the observatory’s spot on Earth) and the times are known accurately.
       ----- Angles, not distances: Telescopes give us directions to the object, not how far away it is. Distance has to be inferred.
       ----- Small, random errors: Measurement noise is modest and not wildly biased.
   --- Why “three” sightings? (the intuitive counting argument)
       ----- To pin down an orbit, you need six numbers (the “orbital elements”: size, shape, tilt, orientation, and where the object is along the path).
       ----- Each sighting gives you two angles (where to point the telescope on the sky).
       ----- Three times × two angles ≈ six pieces of information → enough to solve for the six unknowns (plus we use the time gaps between sightings).

 - Highlight which of these are exact versus which are approximate 

 - What steps are involved to use those assumptions / facts / approximations to get to the 8th order equation? 
   --- Collect three snapshots: Record the sky direction to the object at three known times.
   --- Reconstruct positions: Combine each direction with the observer’s known position at that time; estimate the actual space position of the object by solving for         the missing distances along those sightlines.
   --- Recover velocity: From how the position changes across the three times, estimate the object’s velocity at the middle time.
   --- Convert to an orbit: From one position + one velocity, compute the six orbit descriptors (ellipse size/shape, tilt, orientation, and where the object is).
   --- Predict & refine: Use the orbit to predict future positions (“ephemerides”). Compare to new sightings and tweak the orbit (today we use least-squares, Kalman filters, etc.) to improve accuracy.
   --- Analogy: It’s like seeing a car from three camera frames; if you know the times of the photos, you can infer both where it is and how fast/which way it’s going, then you can predict where it’ll be next.

 - How do we solve the 8th order equation? 
 - How many roots can the 8th order equation have ?
 - Once we have solved the 8th order equation, what are the subsequent steps that we have to take in order to get to an *orbit*? 


More Detailed Topics [You probably need to get to these slightly later on in the thesis/talk] 
 - What are Keplerian elements?
 - What are Cartesian elements ?
 - Why is there any need to convert back and forth between them (what are the advantages of either, why don't you just stick with one of them) ?


Do / Don't ...
 - Don't assume too much knowledge on the part of your audience/reader: 
   E.g. if you are going to talk about orbital elements, then you need to make sure you have introduced those already. 
   Or conversely, if you haven't introduced them already, perhaps you just get by with using less technical terminology in an earlier part of the introduction/talk,
   and delay any discussion of orbital elements (or similar technical terminology) until later on in the thesis/talk.  
 - I don't think there's any need for the talk to contain any of the super-detailed mathematical derivations: just stick to high level summary stuff.

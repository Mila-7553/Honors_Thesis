Some suggestions related to desirable content to include in both 
(a) Your thesis introduction;
(b) The first half / two-thirds of your talk in Portugal. 

N.B. I don't want to write your thesis for your, so I'll restrict myself to just listing some important 
topics that I think you should cover, as well as some suggested things to do & not-do (to avoid confusing 
your readers/audience) 

High Level Overview [not necessarily in this order] 
 - Why did Gauss want to calculate the orbits of asteroids ? 
 - Why do we want to calculate the orbits of asteroids / satellites ?
 - Perhaps provide some historical background to note that in order to solve this problem, 
   Gauss invented a *lot* of mathematics, including the Gaussian distribution and least-squares fitting
 - Be able to provide a very short overview of Gauss' method (you then give more details later on) 
 - Are there better methods? - Yes, tools like orbfit: but when you only have ~3 observations, Gauss' method is just as good and is *fast*

High Level Summary of Gauss' Method [this is probaly just what you already have in your high-] 


More Detailed Topics [You probably need to get to these slightly later on in the intro/talk] 
 - What are Keplerian elements?
 - What are Cartesian elements ?
 - Why is there any need to convert back and forth between them (why don't you just stick with one of them) ?
